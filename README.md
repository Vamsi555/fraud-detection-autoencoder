This project demonstrates how to apply an unsupervised AutoEncoder model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the PyOD library with a TensorFlow backend. The approach is designed for highly imbalanced datasets, such as the anonymized Kaggle credit card dataset, where fraudulent cases are extremely rare compared to normal transactions. The AutoEncoder is trained to reconstruct normal transaction patterns, and transactions that produce higher reconstruction errors during testing are more likely to be identified as anomalies.

To run the project, you must first install the required Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pyod, and TensorFlow version 2.10.0. TensorFlow 2.10.0 is the version compatible with Windows systems. After installing the dependencies, place the creditcard.csv dataset in the same directory as the Python script. You can then execute the program by running python fraud_autoencoder.py from your terminal. The script will load and preprocess the dataset, train the AutoEncoder model, and evaluate it using the test set. When the program finishes, it will display the confusion matrix, classification report, and a reconstruction error plot that illustrates how the model distinguishes normal patterns from fraudulent anomalies.

This repository contains the main Python file used in the experiment, a requirements file documenting the necessary package versions, and this README, which explains how to set up and run the model. The project is intended as an introductory demonstration of how unsupervised deep learning techniques can support fraud detection tasks, especially when labeled data is limited or imbalanced. The model presented here provides a baseline approach that can be extended or integrated into broader fraud detection systems.
